# CS50x2023

## CS50â€™s Introduction to Computer Science
This course teaches you how to solve problems, both with or without prior programming experience.

> This course was taken in 2023, so the labs or problems could change by the time you check my page. You can find the 2023 labs and problems in [CS50x2023](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/), and for the latest labs and problems, you can check [CS50x](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/).
>
>> Please keep in mind that you can not simply copy and submit these codes for your own labs and problems due to Harvard's academic honesty. <br> Students found to be in violation of this policy will be removed from the course. Students who have already completed CS50x, if found to be in violation, will have their CS50 Certificate permanently revoked.

Have fun coding!
